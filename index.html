<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Resource Manager</h2>
<p><b>Resource Manager</b> is a powerful tool that provides convenient loading and unloading of prefabs, scenes, images and other resources of your project. It supports working with <b>Asset Bundles</b> and <b>Streaming Assets</b> folder, which allows you to effectively manage resources in the game. With <b>Resource Manager</b>, you get fast and convenient access to project files through code, which greatly simplifies the development process. This tool tightly integrates with <b>Code Generator</b> and <b>Mods Support</b>, allowing developers to easily add new features and content to their games. The main functions of <b>Resource Manager</b> include:</p><ul>
<li>Loading and unloading of various types of resources (prefabs, scenes, images, etc.).</li>
<li>Support for <b>Asset Bundles</b> for effective resource management.</li>
<li>Working with <b>Streaming Assets</b> folder to store and load data available at runtime.</li>
<li>Convenient access to resources through code for quick interaction.</li>
<li>Integration with <b>Code Generator</b> and <b>Mods Support</b> for extensibility of functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>As already mentioned, <b>Resource Manager</b> is used to load and unload assets in the project. Loading and unloading is very easy:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="COREResourceManager_0.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Let's figure out which fields are responsible for what:</p>
<p><b>Resource Datas</b> - All internal resources that do not follow the general rules of code generation, such as Localization keys, which must be consistent throughout the entire project. In essence, <b>Resource Datas</b> generates enumerations for each of the lists. To add your resource to the list, you must first write a rule by which the enumerations will be generated.</p><ol type="1">
<li><b>Type</b> - resource type (<em>string</em>) or its name, must be unique</li>
<li><b>Paths</b> - paths where the resources are located</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Bundle Datas</b> - a list of all bundles in the game that will be collected. There is no need to manually set the bundle to which each asset belongs. All assets that are inside the folder will be automatically included in the bundle!</p><ol type="1">
<li><b>Name</b> - the name of the bundle, must be unique</li>
<li><b>Variant</b> - the variant of the bundle, must be unique in the bundle</li>
<li><b>Paths</b> - the paths where the resources are located. It is enough to specify the root folder with the resources</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Asset Datas</b> - resources for which enumerations and data for accessing them via <b>Asset Bundles</b> should be generated</p><ol type="1">
<li><b>Name</b> - unique resource name</li>
<li><b>Bundle</b> - bundle to which the resource belongs</li>
<li><b>Paths</b> - paths where resources are located</li>
<li><b>Name Regex</b> - Works in conjunction with <b>Enum Values</b>, at the moment you can specify <b>maximum 2 Regex values</b>. Leave the field blank if you want the resource name to be taken in full. For example, you have resources with the names <em>UI_Player_Bob.png</em>, <em>UI_Player_Tom.png</em>, <em>UI_Enemy_Bill.png</em> and you want to divide them into groups and names, for this you need to write <b>Regex</b>, which will take the necessary strings from the name, in this case <b>Regex</b> will look like this <em>"UI_(.+?)_(.+?)$"</em>. This means that we will take <em>Player</em> and <em>Enemy</em> from the name and create an enumeration with the name <b>Group</b>, then we will take <em>Bob</em>, <em>Tom</em>, <em>Bill</em> from the name and create an enumeration with the name <b>Name</b>. The example below shows that we take two parameters from the name and create enumerations from them. All the rules for constructing enumerations are specified in the <b>Enum Values</b> fields, where each list element corresponds to one <b>Regex</b> value. <div class="image">
<img src="COREResourceManager_2.png" alt=""/>
</div>
 For a more in-depth understanding, please check out <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MT2R_4akHryW4VuUVgxhN9_1MyHXS0yu/view?usp=drive_link">Example</a>.</li>
<li><b>Type</b> - resource type. For example, localization keys or sprites.</li>
<li><b>Directory Save Path</b> - path to generate resources. Leave the field empty if you want the resources to be generated in a common folder</li>
<li><b>Enum Values</b> - rules for constructing enumerations. It is important to remember that the <b>Enum</b> field has priority - if you specify both <b>Name</b> and <b>Enum</b> fields, then the <b>Enum</b> field will ultimately be taken as a more valid rule.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - any enumeration name, may not be unique, for example, <em>size</em>, <em>value</em>, <em>name</em>, etc.</li>
<li><b>Enum</b> - any existing enumeration. for example, <em>UnityEngine.KeyCode</em>. It is important to specify the full path to this enumeration, with all <b>Namespaces</b></li>
<li><b>To Upper</b> - indicates that the enumeration should be written in uppercase <em>Assets/COREToolkit/Scripts/Shared/Generated</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not plan to update to the latest version of <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/311902">C.O.R.E.</a> then there is no need to use <b>PlayerResources</b>. These resources were created for one purpose only - to separate the tool and user (i.e. developer) resources to be independent of each other. This rule does not apply to <b>ColorLibrary</b> since <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/311902">C.O.R.E.</a> is slightly dependent on them.</p>
<p>All bundles are built using the resources that you specified in the <b>PlayerResources</b> settings.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>Bundle names must be unique, just like resource names!</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Mods Support</h2>
<p><b>Mods Support</b> is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of generating and packaging mods for your game. It allows developers or users to easily create and integrate custom modifications, which greatly expands the possibilities of the gameplay and increases replayability. The main features of <b>Mods Support</b> include:</p><ul>
<li>Convenient mod generation: The tool allows you to quickly create and pack mods, which can then be easily integrated into the game.</li>
<li>Project assembly: Based on the use of <b>Assembly Definition</b> and <b>Asset Bundles</b>, which ensures reliable and efficient operation of mods.</li>
<li>Export window for modders: A special interface for exporting mods that simplifies the process of creating and managing custom content.</li>
<li>Setting code restrictions: The ability to set restrictions for code, which allows you to control the functionality of mods and prevent possible conflicts.</li>
<li>Additional materials: Developers can supply additional materials along with the tool, which makes the integration process more convenient.</li>
<li>Starting point for mods: The tool provides a single place to start and stop all mods, making them easier to manage.</li>
<li>Change tracking: The system tracks the addition and removal of mods from the <b>Mods</b> folder, ensuring that the content in the game is up to date.</li>
<li>Compatibility with the engine version: All mods must match the engine version used in the game, which guarantees stability and performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <b>Mods Support</b>, you can easily extend the functionality of your game and give players the ability to create and share their own modifications. <a href="https://github.com/Hello-Meow/ModTool">ModTool</a> was taken as a basis and completely redesigned for its own needs.</p>
<p>Working with mods comes down to a few rules:</p><ul>
<li>You need the <a class="el" href="namespace_c_o_r_e.html">CORE</a> Mod tool</li>
<li>You need Documentation of your project</li>
</ul>
<p>To create your own mod you only need to study the API of the project, create a mod, and then export and add it to the game. Everything else will be done for you <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/311902">C.O.R.E.</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Mod Examples</h3>
<p>For modders, you must provide all the tools they need to develop and integrate their add-ons into your product. For easy customization and export of the mod, <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/311902">C.O.R.E.</a> provides a powerful tool for assembling custom mods. To do this, modders just need to open the mod export window <em>Tools/ModTool/Export Mod</em> and fill in all the fields.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="COREModsSupport_0.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>To start learning the tool, you need to do the following:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Create a new empty Unity project of the same version and with the same settings as your main application</li>
<li>Export the modding tool to your mod project</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ATzY0QnivLHAsahvzn5dI7lONuMbsA-2/view?usp=drive_link">CORE Game Developers Toolkit Mod Examples.unitypackage</a></li>
<li>Using <em>Unity/Assets/Import Packages/Custom Package</em> unzip it into the project</li>
<li>Install the <b>com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json</b> plugin via the Package Manager window</li>
<li>In the <em>Assets/Resources</em> folder, you will find two text files, these are the mod preset settings. Move these two files to the <em>../ProjectName/Library/</em> folder</li>
<li>Open the Mod Exporter window and make sure that all the settings are applied correctly. Otherwise, click the <b>Load</b> button to try to load the settings</li>
<li>Click the <b>Prepare</b> button in the <b>Mod Exporter</b> window to set up resources such as color palette, etc.</li>

REFUND POLICY</h1>
<p>If you’re uncertain about any asset’s workings or have questions before purchasing, please do not hesitate to reach out. We will do our best to answer your questions. Please read this before purchase to avoid any unwelcome surprises.</p>
<p>This policy attempts to clarify the <a href="https://unity.com/pt/legal/as-terms">asset store EULA‘s</a> legal jargon and specifies the practical cases that it does, or does not cover. It does not add refund conditions that aren’t already covered by it.</p>
<p>All Asset Store sales <b>are final</b> as per the EULA section 2.2.9, which is agreed upon at checkout. Digital purchases cannot be returned once downloaded, hence it’s required to agree to waive the right to a refund. Clicking the “Download” button finalizes this agreement.</p>
<p>This is because it is impossible to ensure the package files are deleted after a refund is issued. Keeping both the package and its monetary value is not a fair trade. Therefore, some conditions must be met in order to avoid abuse or supporting impulsive purchases: <b>Conditions that justify a refund:</b></p><ul>
<li>You have not yet downloaded the asset (verified through invoice number).</li>
<li>Accidental purchase, or on wrong account (only valid if not yet downloaded).</li>
<li>The asset was removed from the store within 4 weeks of purchasing.</li>
<li>The asset fails to work as advertised, or there is a vital incompatibility with existing systems (within the confines of the supported platforms, capabilities, and versions). And cannot be resolved in a future update or a hotfix.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Requests are declined if:</b></p><ul>
<li>The invoice date exceeds 14 days prior to the request.</li>
<li>You appear to not have read, misread or misunderstood the store page description (“as advertised”), or otherwise failed to inform yourself through the linked online documentation. This includes details such as:</li>
<li>Minimum/maximum compatible or supported Unity versions</li>
<li>Compatible or supported platforms</li>
<li>Scriptable Render Pipeline compatibility (including the built-in RP)</li>
<li>Listed features and limitations</li>
<li>The asset is claimed to no longer be used.</li>
<li>The package in question went on sale, or an upgrade discount was introduced, shortly after a full-price purchase was made.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find you are in accordance with these conditions, please get in touch on the basis of your request. </p>
